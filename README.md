# Decsription
This is a TensorFlow implementation of the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). This Neural Style 
Transfer algorithm synthesizes new artistic images by combining the content of one image with the style of another image using a pre-trained 
Convolutional Neural Network (VGG-19) .
