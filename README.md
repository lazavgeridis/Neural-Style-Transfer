# Decsription
This is a TensorFlow implementation of the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). This Neural Style 
Transfer algorithm synthesizes new artistic images by combining the content of one image with the style of another image using a pre-trained 
Convolutional Neural Network (VGG-19) . Below you will find some of our generated images.

# Examples

 <img src="images/dit_scream_a5_b100000.png" width="500">
 <img src="images/cont_styl.jpg" width="250">
</p>

Here, we are using the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications as content image and various well known paintings as style images. Clearly,the algorithm produces visually appealing results:
